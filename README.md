## Encrypting Hello world!
Using RSA to demonstrate how to encrypt and decrypt "Hello world!" from ASCII to a secret message.

The following message is encoded into the ASCII decimal code: 

<p align=center> Hello world!

The RSA algorithm is used with prime numbers p = 29 and q = 47 and a public-key (e, N) where e = 17 and N = pq. 
The message is then encrypted and decrypted using the private key d, which is conveniently generated using the extended euclidean algorithm. ðŸ§™

Enjoy!
