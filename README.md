# encrypting_helloworld!
Using RSA to demonstrate how to encrypt and decrypt "Hello world!" from ASCII to a secret message.

The following message is encoded into the ASCII decimal code: 
Hello world!
The RSA algorithm is then used with prime numbers p = 29 and q = 47 and a public key of (e,N) where e = 17 and N = pq. 
The message is then encrypted and decrypted using a private key d, generated using the extended euclidean algorithm. 

Enjoy!
